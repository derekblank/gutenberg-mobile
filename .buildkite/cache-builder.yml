# This pipeline runs via Buildkite's scheduled jobs feature.
#
# It's meant to rebuild various CI caches on a periodic async basis, so as
# not to waste time on every CI job updating the cache.

        repo: automattic/gutenberg-mobile/

steps:
  # Build the Git Repo cache
  #
  # Because this repo is so large, we periodically create a Git Mirror and copy it to S3,
  # from where it can be fetched by agents more quickly than from GitHub, and so that
  # agents then have less new commits to `git pull` by using that cache as starting point
